## This is an AirDrop Delivery App designed to bring AirDrop's crypto through their required task into to my MetaMask wallet without me having to manually performt the task. 

## This github repo shows the adapted code from learning how to build this program, https://github.com/brendanmyrden/AirDrop-Delivery-App

## This is based on, followed through along side 'AirDrop Hunter Tutorial' by Dapp University, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wecy7pvpZi8 - Hats off to Gregory!
